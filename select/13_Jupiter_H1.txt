You used to tell me
The look in my eyes
Could light up the world
Like the stars in your night
I should have known better
Your beautiful lies
They tasted so good
But I was out of my mind
Ten levels off the ground getting lost in time
And missing all the warning signs
Cuz you got me so high that I touched Jupiter
And I was floating way out in your universe
Stuck on Jupiter
Jupiter
Orbiting the sky while you were down on earth
I was floating way out in your universe
We'd head out at dusk
Already drunk on the wine
Was the way that we loved
Just to numb all the fights
Kept me in a haze
Until we turned out the lights
To get through the pain
I thought that I was fine
Cuz you got me so high that I touched Jupiter
And I was floating way out in your universe
Stuck on Jupiter
Jupiter
Orbiting the sky while you were down on earth
I was floating way out in your universe
Stuck on Jupiter
