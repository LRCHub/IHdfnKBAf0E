Mmm Ahh

There's just somethin' 'bout ya
Feels just like I've always know ya
Always hangin' round ya
Ever since the day I found ya
I found ya

You're all I need
You're everything
You're everything I need

You're everything I wanted
You're just another part of me
You're everything I wanted
Everything I wanted

You're everything I wanted
You're just another part of me
You're everything I wanted
Everything I wanted

Mmm Ahh

Somethin' that's inside ya
Lifts me like no other lover
Let my soul surround ya
Forever let me feel the power
Your power

You're all I need
You're everything
You're everything I need

You're everything I wanted
You're just another part of me
You're everything I wanted
Everything I wanted

You're everything I wanted
You're just another part of me
You're everything I wanted
Everything I wanted

Mmm Ahh
Mmm Ahh
Everything I wanted

Somethin' that's inside ya
Lifts me like no other lover
Everything I wanted

You're everything I wanted
(All that I wanted, All that I needed)
You're just another part of me
You're everything I wanted
Everything I wanted

You're everything I wanted
You're just another part of me
You're everything I wanted
Everything I wanted

You're everything I wanted
You're just another part of me
You're everything I wanted
Everything I wanted
