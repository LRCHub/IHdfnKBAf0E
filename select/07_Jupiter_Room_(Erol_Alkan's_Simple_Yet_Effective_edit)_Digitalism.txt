Here is the room that we shared
It's the room that you cared for
So I haven't changed the room
How did the years slip away?
I could swear you're still there
For I haven't changed the room
Now that you're gone
What am I to do?
So many fantasies
Plans that we made
That will never come true
Oh and I haven't changed all that much
And I'm sure you'd be proud
Of the way that I came through
So if you happen to be passing by
To make sure that you'd recognize it
I haven't changed the room
