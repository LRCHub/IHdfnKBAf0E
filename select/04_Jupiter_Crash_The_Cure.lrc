[01:41.62] She follows me down to the sound of the sea
[01:45.63] Slips to the sand and stares up at me
[01:50.64] Is this how it happens? Is this how it feels?
[01:54.74] Is this how a star falls?
[01:59.71] Is this how a star falls?
[02:12.21] 
[02:03.76] The night turns as I try to explain
[02:07.78] Irresistible attraction and orbital plane
[02:12.86] Or maybe it's more like a moth to a flame
[02:17.90] She brushes my face with her smile
[02:21.97] Forget about stars for a while!
[02:37.47] 
[02:25.95] She melts...
[02:29.08] Meanwhile millions of miles away in space
[02:33.04] The incoming comet brushes Jupiter's face
[02:38.12] And disappears away with barely a trace...
[02:59.12] 
[02:45.12] Was that it? Was that the Jupiter show?
[02:50.28] It kinda wasn't quite what I'd hoped for, you know
[02:55.27] Pulling away she stands up slow
[02:59.24] Around her the night turns
[03:04.26] Around her the night turns
[03:17.26] 
[03:28.45] Yeah, yeah, yeah that was it
[03:32.34] That was the Jupiter crash
[03:36.30] Drawn too close and gone in a flash
[03:40.46] Just a few bruises in the region of the splash
[04:03.46] 
[03:44.41] She left to the sound of the sea
[03:48.47] She just drifted away from me
[03:53.53] Yeah, so much for gravity!
